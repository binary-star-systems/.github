# Binary Star Systems

We are free software hackers and functional programming evangelists seeking to
bring purely functional reproducible (operating | programming) systems to the
unenlightened masses.

We are based jointly in historied Cambridge, MA, and beautiful Santa Barbara, CA.

Some of our projects include:

- ‚ùÑÔ∏è Nix/NixOS projects
    - Two flagship Linux distributions, [liminalOS](https://github.com/youwen5/liminalOS) and [QuasarOS](https://github.com/quantum9innovation/quasaros)
    - The automatically-updating [Zen Browser flake](https://github.com/youwen5/zen-browser-flake)
    - The automatically-updating [GitButler flake](https://github.com/youwen5/gitbutler-flake)
- ‚òÄÔ∏è/üåï [Suntheme](https://github.com/quantum9Innovation/suntheme), a purely functional light/dark system colorscheme orchestrator written in Haskell
